                From there, the possibilities are endless. Make it a vegetarian version by adding sauteed red peppers, bell peppers, or onions.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul><li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
             <li>2 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>2 slices bacon crumbled (and/or cooked, crumbled sausage)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Mexican blend or Monterey Jack cheese shredded, divided</li>
             <li>salsa and sour cream to taste</li>
            <h2>Steps</h2> 
            <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, scramble the eggs (add salt and pepper to taste).
            </li>
            <li>Spray skillet or griddle with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Place one tortilla on the skillet or griddle and heat on one side.</li>
            <li>When tortilla is hot, flip and add half of the cheese.
            </li>Add scrambled egg and distribute evenly</li>
            <li>Add bacon over the top</li>
            <li>Sprinkle on remaining cheese and top with remaining tortilla. Cook for about 1 minute or until cheese starts to melt, then CAREFULLY flip (you don't want all the egg falling out).</li>
            <li>When the cheese is melted and the tortilla is golden brown remove from pan. Cut into quarters with a pizza cutter and serve with sour cream and/or salsa.</li>
